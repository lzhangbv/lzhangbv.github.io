# About Me
I am a system researcher at Huawei (HKRC). I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~bli/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor’s Degree from Zhejiang University. 

I am broadly interested in machine learning systems and algorithms, with a special focus on: 1) distributed DNN training, 2) second-order optimization, and 3) learning on graphs. I am currently working on LLMs training and inference.
